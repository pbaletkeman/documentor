## [v2.0.1] - 2025-11-21

### Changed

- Fixed all Checkstyle violations across the repository (LineLength and other issues).
- Reformatted numerous tests to comply with style rules (notable files: `AtomicFileWriterTest.java`, multiple `DocumentationService` tests, CLI handler tests).
- Archived extraneous and temporary test/debug artifacts into `.archived/` and removed malformed stray files from repo root.

### Notes

- Build verification: run `gradlew.bat clean checkstyleTest` — expected result: BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- Artifacts: `documentor.jar` attached to the v2.0.1 GitHub release.
