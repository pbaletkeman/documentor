# Early Configuration Loading Implementation

## Problem

Previously, the Documentor application loaded configuration after command processing had begun, causing null configuration errors when components needed configuration data during initialization.

## Solution

This PR implements early configuration loading by:

1. Creating `EarlyConfigurationLoader` with `@Order(0)` implementing `ApplicationRunner`
2. Enhancing `ExternalConfigLoader` to support multiple command-line formats
3. Adding `@Primary` annotation to bean definition for proper resolution
4. Improving configuration error reporting and logging

## Key Implementation Details

- `EarlyConfigurationLoader` loads configuration at application startup
- Support for multiple argument formats:
  - `--config config.json`
  - `--config=config.json`
  - `analyze,--config,config.json` (for Gradle)
- Configuration registered as Spring bean with primary annotation
- Comprehensive logging for configuration flow tracking

## Benefits

- Configuration available before command processing begins
- No more null configuration errors
- Better integration with Spring's dependency injection
- Support for multiple command-line argument formats
- Improved error handling for configuration issues

## Testing

- Unit tests verify all argument formats and loading paths
- Integration tests confirm configuration availability
- Manual verification with command execution

This change ensures that all components have access to configuration data when they need it, improving the stability and usability of the application.
