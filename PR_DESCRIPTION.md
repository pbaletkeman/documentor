# Early Configuration Loading Implementation

## Problem

Previously, configuration was loaded after command processing had begun, causing issues when commands needed configuration data during initialization. This resulted in null configuration errors and inconsistent behavior.

## Solution

This PR implements early configuration loading by:

1. Creating a new `EarlyConfigurationLoader` class with `@Order(0)` that implements `ApplicationRunner` to load configuration before any commands are processed
2. Enhancing `ExternalConfigLoader` to handle multiple command-line argument formats for greater flexibility
3. Adding `@Primary` annotation to the bean definition to resolve bean conflicts
4. Updating configuration model classes to match expected JSON format
5. Improving logging for better traceability of the configuration loading process

## Changes

- Added `EarlyConfigurationLoader.java` class
- Modified `ExternalConfigLoader.java` to expose configuration loading methods
- Enhanced configuration path extraction to handle various argument formats
- Fixed bean definition conflicts by adding `@Primary` annotation
- Added comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
- Updated README.md with information about the configuration loading process

## Testing

- Added unit tests for `EarlyConfigurationLoader` and enhanced `ExternalConfigLoader`
- Manually tested with `validate-config` command
- Verified configuration is loaded properly for analysis commands
- Confirmed bean conflicts are resolved

## Benefits

- Configuration is now loaded at the earliest possible point in the application lifecycle
- All components have access to the correct settings before they're needed
- Improved error handling and reporting for configuration issues
- Support for multiple command-line argument formats
- Better integration with Spring's dependency injection system

## Documentation

- Added new section to README.md explaining the configuration loading process
- Added comprehensive logging to make the configuration flow easier to follow

This change ensures that all components have access to configuration data when they need it, improving the stability and usability of the application.
